DB watching details in `docs/db-watching.md`.\n\nNotes\n- The implementation watches the active beads SQLite DB (current beads store) rather than a historical `issues.jsonl`. The doc was updated to reflect this.\n- The UI currently supports editing title and description.

Configure ESLint/Prettier and type checks via `tsc`.\n- Standards: Follow project coding/testing standards provided by user instructions.\n\nHigh‑level capabilities:\n- List, filter, and sort issues.\n- View issue details including dependencies.\n- Update status and priority; edit title/description.\n- Auto‑refresh on `.beads/issues.jsonl` changes; push‑based (no polling).\n- Display ready work and basic stats.\n\nNon‑goals (initial phase):\n- Multi‑repo orchestration, auth, or remote access beyond localhost.\n- Advanced visualization (graphs) beyond simple lists/trees.\n\nWS message types (initial draft):\n- `list-issues` { filters }\n- `show-issue` { id }\n- `update-status` { id, status }\n- `edit-text` { id, field: 'title'|'description', value }\n- `update-priority` { id, priority }\n- `create-issue` { title, type, priority, description }\n- `list-ready` {}\n- `subscribe-updates` {}\n\nbd command mapping (examples):\n- list → `bd list --json [filters]`\n- show → `bd show \u003cid\u003e --json`\n- update status/priority → `bd update \u003cid\u003e --status ... | --priority ...`\n- close → `bd close \u003cid\u003e`; reopen → `bd reopen \u003cid\u003e`\n- create → `bd create \"title\" -t \u003ctype\u003e -p \u003cprio\u003e -d \"desc\"`\n- dependencies → `bd dep add|remove \u003ca\u003e \u003cb\u003e`; tree → `bd dep tree \u003cid\u003e` (optional)\n\nLive update source:\n- Observe `.beads/issues.jsonl` (JSON Lines).
