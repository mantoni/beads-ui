{"id":"UI-15","title":"SPA web UI for bd (local app)","description":"Purpose: Build a local, single‑page web app to browse issues, change status, and edit text for the bd CLI tracker.\n\nScope and constraints:\n- Backend: Express app in `/server` serving static files from `/app`.\n- Realtime: All data exchange via WebSocket using the `ws` package.\n- Live updates: Watch `.beads/issues.jsonl`; broadcast changes to the active page/clients.\n- Frontend: `index.html` and ES modules in `/app` (vanilla JS, ESM, JSDoc types).\n- Actions: Client editing sends WS messages; server maps them to `bd` commands.\n- Testing: Use Vitest (Node + jsdom). Configure ESLint/Prettier and type checks via `tsc`.\n- Standards: Follow project coding/testing standards provided by user instructions.\n\nHigh‑level capabilities:\n- List, filter, and sort issues.\n- View issue details including dependencies.\n- Update status and priority; edit title/description.\n- Auto‑refresh on `.beads/issues.jsonl` changes; push‑based (no polling).\n- Display ready work and basic stats.\n\nNon‑goals (initial phase):\n- Multi‑repo orchestration, auth, or remote access beyond localhost.\n- Advanced visualization (graphs) beyond simple lists/trees.\n\nWS message types (initial draft):\n- `list-issues` { filters }\n- `show-issue` { id }\n- `update-status` { id, status }\n- `edit-text` { id, field: 'title'|'description', value }\n- `update-priority` { id, priority }\n- `create-issue` { title, type, priority, description }\n- `list-ready` {}\n- `subscribe-updates` {}\n\nbd command mapping (examples):\n- list → `bd list --json [filters]`\n- show → `bd show \u003cid\u003e --json`\n- update status/priority → `bd update \u003cid\u003e --status ... | --priority ...`\n- close → `bd close \u003cid\u003e`; reopen → `bd reopen \u003cid\u003e`\n- create → `bd create \"title\" -t \u003ctype\u003e -p \u003cprio\u003e -d \"desc\"`\n- dependencies → `bd dep add|remove \u003ca\u003e \u003cb\u003e`; tree → `bd dep tree \u003cid\u003e` (optional)\n\nLive update source:\n- Observe `.beads/issues.jsonl` (JSON Lines). On change, server emits `issues-changed` with minimal payload (timestamp + touched ids if derivable, else invalidate caches).\n\nDev ergonomics:\n- `npm run dev`: concurrently run Express+WS with watch (nodemon) and static app server.\n- `npm test`: vitest unit tests.\n- `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`.\n","acceptance_criteria":"- App lists issues from current bd DB and shows details.\n- Status changes and text edits via UI reflect in bd DB and survive reload.\n- `.beads/issues.jsonl` changes broadcast to connected clients; UI updates without manual refresh.\n- All traffic uses a WebSocket; no fetch REST endpoints for data.\n- Tests: At least core flows (list/show/update/edit) covered by Vitest.\n- Repo contains `/server`, `/app`, and initial docs with run instructions.\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-22T10:40:35.998696+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T10:40:35.998696+02:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"UI-15","depends_on_id":"UI-1","type":"related","created_at":"2025-10-22T11:03:29.872508+02:00","created_by":"max"}]}
